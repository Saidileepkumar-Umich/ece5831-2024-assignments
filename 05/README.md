# Rock Paper Scissors Classifier

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a classifier to recognize images of "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" using a model trained with Google's Teachable Machine. Two Python scripts are provided:

1. `rock-paper-scissors.py`: Classifies a provided image file.
2. `rock-paper-scissors-live.py`: Uses a webcam feed to classify live video.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

### Running the Image Classifier
To classify an image:
```bash
python rock-paper-scissors.py <image_path>
```

### Running the Live Webcam Classifier
To classify using your webcam:
```bash
python rock-paper-scissors-live.py
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder paths with your trained model and labels file from Teachable Machine.

## Demo
A video demonstrating the live classifier can be found on YouTube (link to be added).
